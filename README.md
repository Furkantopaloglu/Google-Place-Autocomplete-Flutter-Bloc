## Usage

  

When you run the application, you will see a text field and a map. Enter a place name or address in the text field and you will see a list of matching places. When you select one of these places, it will be marked on the map. You can zoom in, zoom out or move the map.
  
  

## Setup

  

To run this project, you need to have the following requirements:

- A Google Maps API key (you can get it from https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/get-api-key)


After downloading your project, run the following commands in the terminal:

  

- Install the dependencies with `flutter pub get`.

- Create the .env file with `flutter pub run envied` and add the line `TOKEN=YOUR_API_KEY` to it. (Replace YOUR_API_KEY with your own API key).
	- OR 
		- static const _key = 'YOUR_GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY'; (Replace YOUR_API_KEY with your own API key).

- Run the project with `flutter run`.
